    <p>
    PHPUnit is a testing framework for PHP programming language that provides a way to write unit tests for PHP code. It is an essential tool for developers who want to ensure that their PHP code is robust and reliable.
    Here are some reasons why you should consider using PHPUnit for your PHP projects:
    
    Automated Testing: PHPUnit provides a framework for automated testing that helps to ensure that your code is working as intended. By writing unit tests, you can verify that individual parts of your code are functioning correctly and can catch any potential issues early on.
    
    Regression Testing: PHPUnit makes it easy to perform regression testing. Regression testing involves running tests on code that was previously working to ensure that any changes made since the last testing phase have not caused any issues.
    
    Test-Driven Development (TDD): PHPUnit is often used in TDD, a development methodology that involves writing tests first and then writing code to pass those tests. This can help to ensure that code is well-designed, meets requirements, and is easy to maintain.
    
    Code Refactoring: PHPUnit can be used to test and validate code changes made during the refactoring process. By running tests, you can make sure that the code still works as intended after making changes.
    
    Overall, using PHPUnit can help to improve the quality of your PHP code by automating testing, catching issues early, and ensuring that your code meets requirements.

## Jenkins

<h3> What is jenkins?</h3>
<p>
Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. <br>
It provides a platform for developers to build, test, and deploy their code in an automated and systematic way.<br>

Jenkins is highly configurable and supports a wide range of plugins, making it easy to integrate with various tools and technologies.<br> 
It also has a large and active community that contributes to its development and support.<br>

With Jenkins, you can automate the build and testing of their code, and deploy it to production automatically or with minimal manual intervention. This helps to improve the speed, quality, and reliability of software development and deployment processes.</p>
