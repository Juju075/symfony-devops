    PHPUnit is a testing framework for PHP programming language that provides a way to write unit tests <br>

    for PHP code. It is an essential tool for developers who want to ensure that their PHP code is robust and reliable.
    Here are some reasons why you should consider using PHPUnit for your PHP projects:

    Automated Testing: PHPUnit provides a framework for automated testing that helps to ensure that your code
    is working as intended. By writing unit tests, you can verify that individual parts of your code are functioning
    correctly and can catch any potential issues early on.

    Regression Testing: PHPUnit makes it easy to perform regression testing. Regression testing involves running
    tests on code that was previously working to ensure that any changes made since the last testing phase have not
    caused any issues.

    Test-Driven Development (TDD): PHPUnit is often used in TDD, a development methodology that involves writing
    tests first and then writing code to pass those tests. This can help to ensure that code is well-designed, meets
    requirements, and is easy to maintain.

    Code Refactoring: PHPUnit can be used to test and validate code changes made during the refactoring process.
    By running tests, you can make sure that the code still works as intended after making changes.

    Overall, using PHPUnit can help to improve the quality of your PHP code by automating testing, catching issues
    early, and ensuring that your code meets requirements.
